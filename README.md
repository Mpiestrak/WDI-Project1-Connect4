# Matt Piestrak's Project-1:  Connect4

This is a Connect Four game meant for 2 players.  Players click on the column they wish to drop a chit into.  When four or more chits of the same color are touching either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, an alert will stop the game and alert the winning player.<br/>
